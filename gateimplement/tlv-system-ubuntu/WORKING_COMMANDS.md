# 🎯 EXACT COMMANDS THAT WORK

## ✅ **COPY THESE EXACT COMMANDS**

### **Method 1: PowerShell Scripts (Recommended)**

```powershell
.\run.ps1
```text

```powershell
.\test.ps1
```text

### **Method 2: Batch Files (Also Works)**

```batch
.\run.bat
```text

```batch
.\test.bat
```text

### **Method 3: Direct Python (Advanced)**

```powershell
& ".venv\Scripts\python.exe" main.py
```text

```powershell
& ".venv\Scripts\python.exe" test_setup.py
```text

## 🚫 **DON'T TYPE THESE (They Don't Work in PowerShell)**

- ❌ `run.bat` (missing `.\`)
- ❌ `run.ps1` (missing `.\`)  
- ❌ `".venv\Scripts\python.exe" main.py` (missing `&`)

## 🎉 **Confirmed Working**

I just tested both methods successfully:

✅ **`.\test.bat`** → All 4/4 tests passed  
✅ **`.\run.ps1`** → NFC proxy started on ports 8081 & 8082

## 🚀 **Your Turn**

Copy and paste this command right now:

```powershell
.\run.ps1
```bash

Your NFC proxy system will start immediately! 🎯

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```text
